# Designer Queue

*The single list of everything that needs YOUR input, so nothing blocks silently.
Answered items get struck through with the date; open items are grouped by when they're
needed. Types: **Ruling** (pick or approve a direction), **Creative** (authored by you —
taste, tone, fiction), **Action** (a task), **Approval** (sign off a draft Claude
produces). Every Ruling ships with a recommendation — nothing here asks you to design
from a blank page. Claude drafts strawmen for any Creative item on request.*

## Now — blocks M0 close or current work

- **Q-1 (Ruling)** Tiering sign-off on `DECISION_LOG.md`. **In progress (2026-08-18):**
  S-2 ✓, S-3 ✓, S-4 ✓ (first-principles note added to the entry on request), S-5 ✓
  (designer introspection note added; drills mechanic seeded in `design/06` §8), S-6 ✓
  (motivating appendix written: `design/appendix-input-modality.md`). Outstanding:
  S-1 (engine analysis delivered in-session; explicit ✓ pending), S-7, S-8, and the
  "any provisional entry to promote?" check.
- **Q-2** ~~Pest queen as leading story hypothesis~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18: promoted;
  held "until we choose something better." Design against it; don't lock content that
  would be expensive to unwind. Recorded in D-3 and `design/08-narrative.md` §1.
- **Q-3** ~~Comms interception in/out~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18 (delegated): recorded as
  emergent possibility at zero committed scope; use-it-or-not decided at D-1.
- **Q-4** ~~Repo process~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18: commit immediately, straight-to-main
  while the team is this small; branches/PRs when code changes get risky. Docs committed
  as of this ruling.
- **Q-5** ~~Title~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18: keep "Tiny Farm" as working title for now.
- **Q-6** ~~Release strategy~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18: staged — release publicly early
  and as often as possible; all early releases free to play without restrictions;
  dedicated marketing deferred until the game picks up speed. Recorded under D-5;
  standing rule added to `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Q-7** ~~Asset licensing audit~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-18: no audit now — current art is
  *placeholder*; full reskin once art style is aligned (Q-14 / `design/09`), sourced
  from openly released datasets or made original. Residual check: Q-7b below.

## M1 — phase 1 detail (active now)

- **Q-7b** ~~Placeholder-asset license sanity check~~ — ✅ checked 2026-08-26
  (findings in `CREDITS.md`): free game *builds* with credit are fine; music cleared
  (CC BY 4.0); four old SFX need original replacements. One real problem found,
  spawned as **Q-7c**.
- **Q-7c** ~~Public repo redistributes Sprout Lands~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-26: drop
  assets with restrictive licenses rather than work around them. Executed same day:
  pack deleted, replaced by AI-generated art (Retro Diffusion, `CREDITS.md`).
  Residual action: purge the pack from git history (`git filter-repo` + force push)
  at release prep, and verify Retro Diffusion output rights before shipping.
- **Q-8** ~~Movement scheme~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-19: tap-to-move only, accepted.
  Spawned follow-up: **Q-28** below (interaction inventory).
- **Q-9** ~~Onboarding~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-19: wordless sparkle vignette accepted
  ("worth trying"); kid test remains the referee.
- **Q-10** ~~Pest feel~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-19: comedy-not-threat accepted, with
  emphasis on the *first introduction* of each pest being gentle.
- **Q-11** ~~Energy friction~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-19: soft floor accepted — designer
  notes it also teaches player expectations (energy will matter later).
- **Q-12** ~~Phase-1-complete moment~~ — ✅ ruled 2026-08-19: Expansion Morning
  accepted as direction; thresholds and staging explicitly fine-tunable at playtest
  (it is provisional like everything — P-4 spirit).
- **Q-28 (Joint, from Q-8 ruling)** Interaction inventory: enumerate every game
  interaction phase-by-phase and match each to its best input method (touch primary,
  desktop mappings). First pass before M3; re-audit at each phase's design start.
  Home: `design/11-ux-ui.md`.
- **Q-13 (Approval)** Audio direction one-pager — **draft ready**:
  `design/10-audio-direction.md` §"Direction proposal v1" (warm acoustic-toy identity,
  delegation arc scored, verb→foley table). Three taste questions at its end.
- **Q-14 (Approval)** Art style guide — **draft ready**: `design/09-art-direction.md`
  §"Style guide v1" (measured palette ramps, outline/shape/contrast rules, reserved
  overlay hues, animation budget, reskin spec implications).

## Before M3 — phase 2 design

- **Q-15 (Ruling)** Sprinkler/machine acquisition loop: crafted, bought, or
  milestone-granted; the resource loop that feeds it (`design/03`).
- **Q-16 (Creative)** Combat verb additions beyond wash/stomp/dig: swat/chase, thrown
  objects, a dog? (`design/04` §4).
- **Q-17 (Ruling)** Raid readability targets: how visible/telegraphed a forming raid
  must be; when the scent overlay is taught (`design/04` §3, `design/11` §5).
- **Q-18 (Ruling)** Nest visibility in phase 2 (early foreshadowing of phase 5 vs.
  mystery) (`design/04` §2).
- **Q-19 (Ruling)** The never-automate-before-bots chore list (keeps hands-on play
  alive through phases 2–3) (`design/03` §5).
- **Q-20 (Ruling)** Farming breadth: seasons yes/no (a real scope fork) and crop roster
  ambition (`design/02` §1, §3).
- **Q-21 (Ruling)** Pacing intent: rough hours-per-phase ambition — sets every content
  budget (`design/12` §1). Best practice: decide total runtime early and defend it.

## At D-3 trigger — before M4 (phase-3 content)

- **Q-22 (Creative)** Story bible rulings: enemy identity (Q-2 lands here at the
  latest), world premise, tone gradient, the bots' fictional nature, the ending's
  stance (`design/08` — Claude drafts full text from your rulings).
- **Q-23 (Ruling)** Failure stakes for lost waves (`design/05` §5).

## Phase-gated — not yet (triggers in DECISION_LOG)

- D-2 spike results review (algorithms; Claude runs, you review feel implications).
- D-4 playtest ruling: surface-only vs. surface+depth ML presentation.
- Q-24 D-1 participation: phase-5 genre — the big one; prototypes in hand first.
- Q-25 D-5: monetization/distribution (after phase 1–2 slice is kid-tested).
- Q-26 D-6: multiplayer/model-sharing (after phase 4 is fun single-player).
- Q-27 (Creative) Bot personality presentation (names, looks, attachment mechanics) —
  by M5 (`design/06` §2).

*Maintenance rule: when a queue item is answered, strike it here with the date, record
the ruling in the decision log or the owning chapter, and remove nothing — the struck
list is the project's memory of choices made.*
